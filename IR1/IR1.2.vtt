00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:08.740
There’s been a long-term human interest
or fascination in building machines that look

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:14.619
and act like we do. Back in the 18th and 19th
centuries, people were building machines that

00:00:14.619 --> 00:00:19.140
they called Automata, and some examples of
them are shown here. Essentially, they’re

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:24.350
very ingenious, clock-work machines filled
with gears and cams and so on.

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:29.500
The example the writer draftsman shown here
on the right hand side, was able to perform

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:35.590
very, very elaborate drawings. An example
here, a drawing of a sheep is shown. An earlier

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:41.570
and very famous example of machines of this
class is the digesting duck and once again

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:46.010
it is a clock-work machine. What you’d do
with this duck is you would feed it with small

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:50.660
pellets which it would appear to eat and they
would pass through the digestive tracts of

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:53.100
the duck and be eventually excreted.

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:58.440
They’re able to build a machine that appeared
to be life-like, it would eat and it would

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:05.110
excrete. Two of the important functions of
something that is alive. At that time, this

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:09.950
was considered quite wonderful, an example
of technological progress, how they were able

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:15.080
to build machines that were very, very life-like.
Of course by today’s standards, it looks

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:19.240
very, very primitive but at that time, it
was an amazing achievement.

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:25.190
Now, the gentleman who designed this, Vaucanson,
went on to do some more useful things. He

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:31.470
got involved in automating the process of
silk weaving. The technology of weaving was

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:37.400
advanced further by Jacquard and he introduced
the innovation of controlling the weave pattern

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:44.920
by means of a series of punched wooden cards.
So, this was a form of automated machine and

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:49.479
it was programmable. The pattern that came
out depended on the patterns of holes punched

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:51.930
in those wooden cards.

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:57.830
The notion of punch card control was picked
up by Charles Babbage, when he was conceiving

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:04.229
a mechanical computing engine in the late
1800s. At that time he didn't have the technology

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:10.039
to actually build this machine but he introduced
the really important notion of a general-purpose

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:15.650
computing engine and the computation that
it performed is dictated by a program. In

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:19.500
his case, input on punched cards.

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:25.090
The ideas embodied in this machine influenced
later electronic computing devices. For an

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:29.790
instance, the ENIAC Computer that was built
during World War II and from that machine,

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:35.560
we can trace a lineage to the computers we
use every day, in our laptops and in our mobile

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:42.390
phones, and computers of course, are a critical
component of robot systems that we build today.

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:48.069
We can perhaps think of a robot as a computer
that can do things to the physical world.

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:53.230
The other really important innovation that
led to robotics as we know them today is this

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:58.379
work that was done after World War II at the
Argonne National Laboratory in the United

00:02:58.379 --> 00:03:04.840
States. In there, they were faced by a problem
of assembling nuclear weapons. This required

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:11.510
them to handle, to manipulate pieces of material
that were radioactive. This was a task that

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:16.019
couldn't be undertaken by human beings because
it would injure or kill the people who did

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:22.140
that work. We needed to have machines to handle
that material instead but the problem was

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:27.730
that we need a lot of skill and intelligence
in order to manipulate this radioactive material,

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:31.209
so, they came up with a concept called teleoperation.

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:35.629
The people in white coats are sitting with
what are called the master manipulator arms

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:41.159
so they would grab those arms with their hands
and they would move them. The arms over here

00:03:41.159 --> 00:03:47.190
are referred to as the slave arms. They move
in such a way as to mimic the motion of the

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:52.129
master arm. So, the people who were doing
the assembly work and controlling the master

00:03:52.129 --> 00:03:58.440
arms, the slave arms are in a remote room
performing work on the radioactive material.

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:03.250
Video of what’s going on in the radioactive
room is transmitted back to the people doing

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:08.510
the work with the master arm so they can see
what’s happening on a TV monitor. They move

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:14.970
os braços mestres, os braços escravos movem em sincronia
e realizam a tarefa remotamente. Essa técnica é

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:19.919
chamada teleoperação. Ela não é de fato robótica. 
De certa forma, você pode considerar ela como uma sofisticada

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:25.869
tecnologia de controle remoto. Foi bastante
importante completar essa tarefa especial

00:04:25.869 --> 00:04:27.860
no Laboratório Nacional de Argonne.

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:33.259
Essa tecnologia é uma importante precursora
da produção moderna de robôs. O que nós fazemos

00:04:33.259 --> 00:04:38.059
é cortar o fio entre o braço mestre
e o braço escravo e, ao invés do braço

00:04:38.059 --> 00:04:43.400
mestre mandar os comandos para o braço escravo,
colocamos um computador no lugar. Então, o computador

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:48.199
está enviando comandos para o braço escravo,
o qual está se movendo conforme esses sinais

00:04:48.199 --> 00:04:53.909
provenientes do computador. Obviamente, o computador 
é um dispositivo infinitamente reprogramável

00:04:53.909 --> 00:04:58.740
por isso nós podemos ordenar o braço escravo
fazer qualquer coisa que quisermos e agora,

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:03.059
não há nenhum ser humano envolvido.
Nós criamos um robô.

00:05:03.059 --> 00:05:07.589
E talvez a primeira pessoa que teve
essa ideia foi George Devol, esse homem 

00:05:07.589 --> 00:05:14.050
aqui, um grande inventor americano que 
faleceu recentemente. Ele teve a ideia de criar

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:19.039
o que ele chamou de automação universal 
que foi encurtada para Unimation. Esse foi o

00:05:19.039 --> 00:05:24.930
nome da empresa que ele fundou em 1956
com Joseph Engelberger. Eles fundaram a

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:30.199
empresa para produzir robôs industriais que
iriam eventualmente trabalhar na planta da

00:05:30.199 --> 00:05:35.719
General Motors. O primeiro dos seus robôs que foi
instalado em 1961 está mostrado aqui. O que

00:05:35.719 --> 00:05:40.369
esse robô fazia era descarregar as peças 
de uma máquina de fundição em moldes.

00:05:40.369 --> 00:05:46.300
Esse foi o início da revolução de robôs
trabalhando na indústria manufatureira. Unimation,

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:51.369
Inc. foi a primeira empresa que construiu robôs
para a manufatura. Eles foram os pioneiros. Eles

00:05:51.369 --> 00:05:56.080
não estão mais em atividade e hoje, há
muitas, muitas empresas que constroem robôs para

00:05:56.080 --> 00:06:01.389
manufatura, mas a maior parte delas podem rastrear sua
descendência, suas ideias o até mesmo suas pessoas

00:06:01.389 --> 00:06:06.749
para essa pequena firma fundada em 1956 em
Connecticut nos Estados Unidos.
