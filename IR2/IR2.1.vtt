00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:07.759
The most common type of Geometry is known
as Euclidean Geometry and it’s named after

00:00:07.759 --> 00:00:13.119
Euclid of Alexandria and he was a Greek who
lived a long time ago in Egypt.

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:20.159
Around 300 BC, he wrote a very, very famous book. In
fact, a set of 13 books. It was called The

00:00:20.159 --> 00:00:25.400
Elements. And, this is the basis of the Geometry
that you learned when you were at school.

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:31.009
It’s the Geometry of things in a plane and
of things in three-dimensional space. It’s

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:37.809
Geometry about lines and triangles and circles.
It’s based on a few axioms, if you like

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:43.309
fundamental underlying principles. And, from
these few axioms, all the other principles

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:50.870
of Geometry can be derived. Importantly, there
are no numbers in Euclidean Geometry. We have

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:55.749
lines. We have letters. We talk about parallel
lines and we talk about right angles, but

00:00:55.749 --> 00:01:01.390
there are no numbers in Euclidean Geometry
and there are no coordinate frames either.

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:07.300
Rene Descartes was a very, very famous thinker
in the 17th Century. He was a philosopher.

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:12.800
He was a mathematician and he was even a part
time mercenary in his younger days. He’s

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:17.050
often referred to as the Father of Modern
Philosophy and he was particularly famous

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:23.500
for the translation from the original Latin
of this quote, “I think, therefore I am.”

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:28.450
There are many stories about Descartes’
life. One that I particularly like is the

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:33.190
fact that he found that was very, very useful
to lay in bed all through the morning and

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:37.730
think. It was his thinking time. And, it’s
a really great principle.

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:42.070
One morning, he was lying in bed, looking
at the wall, and a fly came in, and it landed

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:46.300
on the wall. And, he realized that he would
be able to describe the position of the fly

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:51.100
simply in terms of two numbers. So wherever
the fly was on the wall, it could be described

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:56.930
very succinctly using just two numbers. And,
this is the basis of the Cartesian coordinate

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:02.310
frame where we represent the position of something
in the plane using two coordinates, two numbers.

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:07.780
So, the very important thing that Descartes
did was he added Algebra to Euclidean Geometry.

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:13.450
And, that allowed us then to express shapes
in terms of equations. We can express lines

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:18.060
in terms of equation. We have the equations
for two lines. We can work out how they intersect

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:23.270
and what angle they intersect. It’s the
fusion of Algebra with the ancient Geometry.

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:28.840
We refer to this as Cartesian Geometry or
Analytic Geometry. It’s called Cartesian.

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:34.720
That’s derived from his name in Latin which
was Cartesius. So, he is the one who developed

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:39.970
the coordinate system, a very, very familiar
concept to us today, but it dates back to

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:48.420
only the 17th Century. So, let’s look at
a 2D coordinate frame. We have a pair of axes.

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:53.870
Each of these is a real number line and they
intersect at a point that we refer to as the

00:02:53.870 --> 00:03:00.569
origin. So, two axes form a 2D coordinate
frame, an x-axis and a y-axis. Now, let’s

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:05.300
describe a point using this two-dimensional
coordinate frame. In order to do that, we

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:10.660
drop a line down to the x-axis and its distance
from the origin we refer to by the quantity

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:15.620
a. And, we drop another line across to the
y-axis and the distance along the y-axis from

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:20.390
the origin we refer to as the distance b.
So, the point P can be described very succinctly

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:24.550
using a pair of numbers and we write them
in brackets just like that.

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:29.840
A mathematician would say that a point is
a location in an n-dimensional space. We would

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:36.020
say that the point P is an element of, or belongs
to, the set of real numbers to the power of

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:41.890
n. In this case, it would be R squared. We
can represent the point by a Cartesian coordinate.

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:46.670
We can also refer to it as an n-tuple. That’s
a group of n numbers. We number them from

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:52.840
x1, x2, all the way up to xn. Again, in the
simple two-dimensional case, n is simply equal

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:57.599
to 2. We can think of a vector as an arrow
from the origin of our coordinate frame to

00:03:57.599 --> 00:04:04.500
the point of interest. And, we denote vectors
by lower case letters. Points by upper case

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:08.890
letters, vectors by lower case letters. In
this case, lower case p.

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:14.580
A vector has got two components. A horizontal
component of length a, and a vertical component

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:19.859
of length b. We write the vector p differently
to the way we write the point P. We write

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:24.490
it as a vector. That’s a stack of numbers,
one above the other. In this case, a above

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:29.770
b. So, it’s a two element vector. It’s
also the same as a 2 by 1 matrix.

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:33.010
That’s a matrix with two rows and one column.

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:36.330
A mathematician would say that a vector is an element of an

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:41.830
n-dimensional vector space and we'd write
that as lower case p is an element of or belongs

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:47.749
to the set of real numbers to the power of
n. Once again, in this simple case, n is equal

00:04:47.749 --> 00:04:52.620
to 2 because it’s a two-dimensional coordinate
frame. We can represent our vector, our arrow

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:57.659
on the coordinate frame, as a mathematical
n vector, a vector with two elements. And

00:04:57.659 --> 00:05:03.669
so, that’s the elements x1, x2, all the
way up to xn and we apply the transpose operator.

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:09.909
Here, I’ve written the vector as a row vector.
The elements are next to each other horizontally.

00:05:09.909 --> 00:05:14.650
When I transpose it, it becomes a column vector,
the elements one above the other, and this

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:19.319
will become important later, when we start
to multiply matrices and vectors together.

00:05:19.319 --> 00:05:24.759
We can also consider that a vector is a relative
displacement. It talks about a motion. How

00:05:24.759 --> 00:05:30.729
do we get from the origin to the point P?
How do we get there? Well, we follow the path

00:05:30.729 --> 00:05:35.080
which is this vector, this arrow. Another
important consideration is that this vector

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:40.339
has a particular starting point. And so, we
refer to this as a bound vector. So, this

00:05:40.339 --> 00:05:45.370
vector here shown in red is different to this
vector here. Although they’ve got the same

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:49.849
length and they’ve got the same angle, they
are different vectors. Important to keep in

00:05:49.849 --> 00:05:54.710
mind that in this course, all of our vectors
are bound. They have a particular starting

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:59.659
point. They’re defined with respect to a
particular coordinate frame.

00:05:59.659 --> 00:06:04.819
Another way we can express this vector, lower
case p, is in terms of unit vectors. So, let’s

00:06:04.819 --> 00:06:10.360
define two unit vectors. These are vectors
with a length of 1 and I denote those with

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:16.909
a hat symbol on top. So, we have the unit
vector x hat and the unit vector y hat. Now,

00:06:16.909 --> 00:06:24.210
I can express my vector in terms of two components.
One component is the distance a multiplied

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:30.830
by the unit vector x hat, plus another vector,
a vertical vector, which is the distance b

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:38.400
multiplied by the unit vector y hat. So, this
is a component representation of a vector

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:42.270
and we’ll be using this notation later on
in this lecture.

00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:48.129
Importantly, points and vectors are different
things. A point defines a location. We can’t

00:06:48.129 --> 00:06:53.759
adicionar dois pontos juntos. Não faz sentido.
E, nem podemos multiplicar dois pontos. É

00:06:53.759 --> 00:06:59.680
um conceito sem sentido. Vetores não definem uma
localização. Eles especificam como sair de uma

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:05.879
localização para outra. Vetores são objetos que 
nós podemos adicionar e subtrair. E, podemos

00:07:05.879 --> 00:07:11.259
multiplicar um vetor por um escalar. Eu posso
ter um vetor e multiplica-lo por 2. Agora, eu

00:07:11.259 --> 00:07:15.789
tenho uma seta que é duas vezes maior, mas na
mesma direção e com o mesmo começo

00:07:15.789 --> 00:07:21.319
do vetor que eu tinha antes. A diferença
entre dois pontos é um vetor. Então, eu posso

00:07:21.319 --> 00:07:25.710
pegar a diferença entre dois pontos e 
o resultado não é mais um ponto e sim

00:07:25.710 --> 00:07:32.339
um vetor. Da mesma forma, eu posso definir um
ponto em termos de um deslocamento de um vetor

00:07:32.339 --> 00:07:38.029
do ponto inicial. Então, para o caso bidimensional,
um ponto é representado por dois números reais

00:07:38.029 --> 00:07:43.339
e um vetor é também representado pelos dois
números reais. Mas, pontos e vetores são coisas

00:07:43.339 --> 00:07:47.539
diferentes.
Precisamos ser cuidadosos quando criamos um sistema

00:07:47.539 --> 00:07:52.300
de coordenadas. Essa é a forma padrão. É
referido como sistema de coordenadas destro.

00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:58.449
nós giramos do eixo x em 90° até o eixo y.
E, aqui está um outro exemplo

00:07:58.449 --> 00:08:03.960
de um sistema de coordenadas destro. Se nós
virássemos o quadro de cabeça para baixo

00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:09.249
agora teríamos o eixo x nessa direção e o
eixo y para baixo. Então, nós giraríamos isso

00:08:09.249 --> 00:08:16.169
em 90° para baixo a fim de definir o eixo y.
Agora, nós precisamos ser bem consistentes na

00:08:16.169 --> 00:08:20.830
forma de definir o sistema de coordenadas e nós
sempre usaremos o sistema destro.

00:08:20.830 --> 00:08:25.599
Nós nunca usaremos um sistema de coordenadas 
assim, apenas sistemas que se parecem com isso.

00:08:25.599 --> 00:08:30.639
Quando nós construímos um sistema de coordenadas
bidimensional de dois eixos, de fato, há duas

00:08:30.639 --> 00:08:34.979
formas diferentes de construirmos esse
sistema de coordenadas. Um sistema 

00:08:34.979 --> 00:08:40.050
canhoto e um destro. 
Agora, nesse curso, nós vamos apenas

00:08:40.050 --> 00:08:45.240
lidar com o sistema de coordenadas destro.
Então, como construímos um sistema destro?

00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:51.529
Bem, nós começamos desenhando o eixo x
primeiro e o eixo y é criado ao girarmos

00:08:51.529 --> 00:08:58.339
o eixo x em 90° no sentido anti-horário.
Isso nos dá um sistema de coordenadas

00:08:58.339 --> 00:09:02.949
destro. Então, não importa a orientação do 
do sistema, a orientação relativa dos eixos

00:09:02.949 --> 00:09:08.829
x e y é muito crítica e deve seguir
essa convenção. Outra coisa importante

00:09:08.829 --> 00:09:15.040
a se manter na mente é que a geometria euclidiana
se aplica apenas na superfície plana. E, um dos

00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:19.949
postulados e axiomas é muito claro sobre
isso, diz que linhas paralelas nunca

00:09:19.949 --> 00:09:23.180
se cruzam e esse é, é claro, o caso
em um plano.

00:09:23.180 --> 00:09:28.910
No entanto, em algo como uma esfera, por
exemplo, a superfície do nosso planeta, isso

00:09:28.910 --> 00:09:34.440
não se aplica mais. As linhas paralelas no 
equador irão se cruzar nos polos. As regras

00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:39.959
da geometria euclidiana não se aplicam a tal
superfície, mas diríamos que a superfície

00:09:39.959 --> 00:09:46.959
da Terra leva a uma geometria não-euclidiana.
No Entanto, numa pequena área, a geometria

00:09:46.959 --> 00:09:51.959
euclidiana é uma aproximação muito boa.
Então, na escala de uma sala, talvez até na

00:09:51.959 --> 00:09:56.689
escala de uma cidade, a geometria euclidiana 
– o fato de linhas paralelas não se cruzarem

00:09:56.689 --> 00:09:59.509
- é uma suposição muito boa a ser feita.
