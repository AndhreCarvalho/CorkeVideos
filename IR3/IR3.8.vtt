00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:08.320
Consider these two coordinate frames, frame
A and frame B. They are both right-handed

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:09.920
coordinate frames.

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:13.589
And the problem we’re trying to solve is
how do we describe the rotation of frame B

00:00:13.589 --> 00:00:19.200
with respect to frame A. Imagine we could
pick up frame A and rotate it in space so

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:23.870
that its axes were parallel to those of frame
B. How do we do that?

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:29.560
Well, a very famous Swiss mathematician, Leonhard
Euler, came up with what’s called the Rotation

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:30.560
Theorem.

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:36.280
It states that two three-dimensional coordinate
frames are related by a sequence of elementary

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:40.550
rotations such as those about the x-axis,
the y-axis, the z-axis.

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:45.460
We need to apply no more than three of those,
but the rotations in this sequence need to

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:50.719
be about different axes; that is we’d rotate
about x-axis, then the y-axis, then maybe

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:53.260
the x-axis again or maybe about the z-axis.

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:59.370
So any rotation can be expressed in terms
of no more than three rotations as long as

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:04.780
those three rotations are consecutively about
different axes.

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:07.530
Let’s demonstrate this Rotation Theorem.

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:12.460
Here, I have my world reference frame and
here I have a coordinate frame that has got

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:14.310
an arbitrary orientation in space.

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:19.270
And so, the Rotation Theorem says that I should
be able to take this coordinate frame and

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:23.640
with simply three elementary rotations achieve
an orientation like this.

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.039
So, I’m going to take a copy of that world
reference frame.

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:30.290
And, first thing I’m going to do is to rotate
it a little bit around the x-axis.

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:34.350
Then, I’m going to rotate it a little bit
around the y-axis, and then I’m going to

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.549
rotate it a bit around the z-axis.

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:40.770
And if I pick this axis up and put it in here,
we’ll see that it now has a roughly the

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.200
same orientation as the blue frame that I
started with.

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:51.039
So, let’s write down all the possible sequences
of rotation, where we apply this caveat that

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:55.340
no two successive rotations are about the
same axis.

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:58.700
In fact, there are two of them and I’ve
written them all down here.

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:03.590
These rotations fall into two groups and the
group shown here are referred to as Euler

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:04.590
angles.

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.869
And, they are the ones where there are two
rotations about the same axis.

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:12.530
The first one is rotation about X, then Y,
then X again.

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:16.890
Well, this one over here is Y, then Z, then
Y again.

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:24.030
So, in the Euler angle group, a particular
axis will appear twice, but not twice consecutively.

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:29.250
This particular group; rotation around Z,
then around Y, and then around Z is quite

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:34.250
commonly called Euler angles, but in fact
there are six Euler angles.

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:38.470
So, we need to be very, very careful when
we talk about an angle sequence.

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:41.010
It’s in fact not good enough just to say
Euler angles.

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:46.299
We should be very specific and say ZYZ Euler
angles.

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:51.040
Different engineering communities use different
conventions, and the ZYZ convention is pretty

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:55.269
common in robotics and in aerospace, but there
are other engineering disciplines where they

00:02:55.269 --> 00:02:57.110
usam convenções diferentes.

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:00.810
Tenha muito, muito cuidado ao falar sobre
ângulos de Euler.

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:05.870
Vamos experimentar e aqui estamos falando
sobre a sequência ZYZ dos ângulos de Euler.

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:13.989
Vou usar a função eul2r da Toolbox,
que recebe três argumentos angulares, os três

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:14.989
ângulos de Euler.

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:17.459
E vou fornecer a eles valores 
simples: 0.1, 0.

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:20.430
2 e 0.3 radianos, respectivamente.

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:25.780
E, aqui está a matriz de rotação resultante
que corresponde aos três ângulos de Euler.

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:31.590
Então você pode pensar nisso como duas representações
alternativas para orientação do sistema

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:32.590
de coordenada.

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:37.549
Podemos representá-lo como uma matriz ortogonal
3 por 3 ou podemos representá-lo por três números

00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:40.129
que são os ângulos de Euler.

00:03:40.129 --> 00:03:41.909
Eu posso realizar a operação inversa.

00:03:41.909 --> 00:03:45.180
Eu posso converter uma matriz de rotação em
ângulos de Euler.

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:53.930
Para fazer isso, eu uso a função tr2eul e
passo a matriz de rotação que

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:55.010
acabamos de computar.

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:57.790
E aqui temos os ângulos de Euler.

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:02.959
Então posso converter ângulos de Euler em uma matriz de 
rotação, uma matriz de rotação de volta aos ângulos de Euler.

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:08.790
Vamos dar uma olhada em um caso um pouco diferente
em que o ângulo de Euler médio é um número

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:11.590
negativo e o resultado é uma matriz de rotação.

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:15.550
Esta é uma matriz de rotação diferente da que
tínhamos antes, porque é um conjunto diferente

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:16.750
de ângulos de Euler.

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:21.160
Agora vou converter essa matriz de rotação
de volta para ângulos de Euler.

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:26.389
E veremos que os ângulos de Euler que
obtemos não são os ângulos de Euler com

00:04:26.389 --> 00:04:27.840
os quais começamos.

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:32.830
Então essa é outra consideração importante
quando estamos representando orientação em

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:38.940
termos dessas seqüências de três ângulos: que elas
não são únicas, mas são dois diferentes

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:43.870
conjuntos de ângulos de Euler que resultam
exatamente na mesma matriz de rotação.

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:48.470
E só para verificar se é esse o caso,
vou converter esse conjunto diferente

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:51.840
de ângulos de Euler em uma matriz de rotação.

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:57.520
Vou fornecer essa resposta e podemos ver
a matriz de rotação resultante.

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:01.620
E podemos ver que é exatamente a mesma
que esta.

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:06.780
Portanto, existem dois conjuntos de ângulos de Euler
que resultam exatamente na mesma orientação no

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:12.240
espaço, a mesma matriz de rotação.

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:16.700
O outro grupo de sequências de rotação é
comumente chamado ângulos de Cardan.

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:21.840
Estes são nomeados após um personagem italiano
muito famoso, ou infame, que era médico, astrólogo

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:25.350
e jogador e passou algum tempo
na cadeia por heresia.

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:30.610
Mas uma pessoa muito, muito inventiva, ele inventou
a fechadura com combinação e inventou a junta

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:35.160
universal, a coisa que transmite torque de um
motor na frente do carro para as rodas

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:36.770
na parte traseira do carro.

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:41.600
Ele também publicou amplamente sobre probabilidade e
foi uma das primeiras pessoas a resolver equações

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:43.289
polinomiais cúbicas e quáticas.

00:05:43.289 --> 00:05:45.789
Então, uma pessoa muito, muito brilhante.

00:05:45.789 --> 00:05:50.199
Os ângulos do Cardan envolvem rotações em
torno de diferentes eixos.

00:05:50.199 --> 00:05:54.440
Portanto, nenhuma letra é repetida na
sequência de rotação.

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:58.680
The two of them are often referred to as roll,
pitch and yaw angles.

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:03.680
That’s the sequence XYZ or the sequence
ZYX.

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:08.479
And which particular one is used as roll,
pitch, yaw angles depends a bit on the context

00:06:08.479 --> 00:06:09.479
of the problem.

00:06:09.479 --> 00:06:16.319
Roll, pitch, yaw angles are a really common
convention for orientation of bodies in three-dimensional

00:06:16.319 --> 00:06:17.319
space.

00:06:17.319 --> 00:06:22.520
We have the x-axis pointing forward and so
the roll angle is rotation around the x-axis.

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:24.960
So that’s the first rotation that we do.

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:29.380
Now we perform a rotation around the y-axis
and that’s referred to as pitch.

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:31.069
So that’s this sort of motion.

00:06:31.069 --> 00:06:36.069
And then after that rotation, we do a rotation
around the z-axis and we refer to that as

00:06:36.069 --> 00:06:37.069
yaw motion.

00:06:37.069 --> 00:06:42.470
So roll, pitch, yaw description of attitude
is a rotation around the x-axis, then around

00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:45.700
the y-axis, and then around the z-axis.

00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:50.319
A way to demonstrate this principle of three
consecutive rotations is with this mechanism,

00:06:50.319 --> 00:06:52.550
a thing called a Gimbal mechanism.

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:54.410
So, there are two coordinate frames here.

00:06:54.410 --> 00:06:57.720
We have the world reference coordinate frame
here, the big red frame.

00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:00.620
And, we have a smaller coordinate frame in
the middle here.

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:07.520
Now, we can make a rotation around the x-axis,
which is a motion like this.

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:11.600
We can rotate around the y-axis, which is
a rotation like this.

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:14.110
And, we can rotate around the z-axis.

00:07:14.110 --> 00:07:19.860
So, I can put this inner coordinate frame
at any orientation that I like and the gimbals

00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:23.330
will find the appropriate angles to allow
that to happen.

00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:28.849
So this demonstrates very clearly shows that any
orientation of this inner frame can be achieved

00:07:28.849 --> 00:07:35.160
by arbitrary choice of three rotation angles
around the x, y, and z-axis.

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:39.449
Let’s have a look at some roll, pitch, yaw
angles in practice.

00:07:39.449 --> 00:07:46.699
This is a schematic diagram of NASA’s lunar
module from the late ’60s and early ’70s.

00:07:46.699 --> 00:07:49.440
We can see the coordinate frames indicated
on here.

00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:55.009
We can see that they define roll as rotation
around the z-axis which is toward the front

00:07:55.009 --> 00:08:00.870
of the vehicle and they have defined yaw as
being around the x-axis which is the vertical

00:08:00.870 --> 00:08:04.130
axis for this particular vehicle.

00:08:04.130 --> 00:08:08.620
The MATLAB functions for roll, pitch, yaw
angles are very similar to those for Euler

00:08:08.620 --> 00:08:09.620
angles.

00:08:09.620 --> 00:08:14.430
We used the function rpy2r and we pass in
the roll, pitch, yaw angles.

00:08:14.430 --> 00:08:16.550
I’ve just made up some simple numbers here.

00:08:16.550 --> 00:08:17.660
The roll angle is 0.1

00:08:17.660 --> 00:08:18.660
radians.

00:08:18.660 --> 00:08:20.690
The pitch angle is 0.2 radians.

00:08:20.690 --> 00:08:23.700
And the yaw angle is 0.3 radians.

00:08:23.700 --> 00:08:27.480
And this is the resulting orthogonal rotation
matrix.

00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:31.340
Once again, there is an inverse function.

00:08:31.340 --> 00:08:39.150
So tr2rpy, and I pass in the rotation matrix
and the result are roll, pitch, yaw angles,

00:08:39.150 --> 00:08:41.010
the same as those that I started with.
